# Thoughts on art

*This is probably going to be a bit more contemplative and earnest than weird and webby but this is my website and I can do what I want* ðŸ˜‚

When I think about art, I think about a few things:
- the weird feeling that you get in an art gallery that you don't really "get" it, at least without reading the little cards next to the artwork
- dealing with extreme frustration with doing my own work in any artistic medium except maybe the web (and even barely comfortable with that!)
- the ability of my friends to do art that is extremely good, and a feeling that it is unimaginable to get even close to their level

So I've never really had a great relationship with art ðŸ˜…

A year or two ago I watched a REALLY good video online by PhilosophyTube, that went through many different aspects of art.

It led me down a spiral of other interesting videos on art, mostly covering various grifts / schemes for rich people to avoid tax, or how to interpret art.

This next one was by far my favourite; it really broke down modern art for me in a super accessible way.

I slowly also got a bit better at doing art. I'm still not great but I am trying to enjoy the process when I get a chance, to do some watercolours. I've accepted that unless I really put a lot of consistent effort in, it will only ever be just a bit better than bad ðŸ˜…
